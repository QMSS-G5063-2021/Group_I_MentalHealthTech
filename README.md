In this project, our group wants to gauge the prevalence of certain mental health disorders within the tech industry, and how mental health is viewed within the tech/IT workplace. We used dataset from 2016 OSMI Mental Health in Tech Survey and intended to provided answers to the questions below. 
1. How do people across genders and ages perform differently in mental health conditions？
2. How do mental health treatment and mental health services benefit differentiate among states in the US based on the response frequency? Can they be presented by map?
3. How do people among different job types, company sizes and genders respond to mental health questions?
4. What are people’s attitudes towards mental health in workplace? Can they be presented by wordcloud in positive or negative way?

**Data Description**

Currently over 1400 responses, the ongoing 2016 survey aims to measure attitudes towards mental health in the tech workplace, and examine the frequency of mental health disorders among tech workers. The survey is interested in gauging how mental health is viewed within the tech/IT workplace, and the prevalence of certain mental health disorders within the tech industry. The Open Sourcing Mental Illness team of volunteers will use this data to drive our work in raising awareness and improving conditions for those with mental health disorders in the IT workplace.
